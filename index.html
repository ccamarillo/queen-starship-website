                    <p>
                        I've never been homeless, but I have starved at times.  But in Februrary, 2020, I found myself speaking to my real estate agent about the possiblity of selling my home to get by.  I had been laid off from my five-year job at Vacasa, a fast-growing vacation rental management startup here in Portland.  The COVID-19 situation in Oregon left me unable to find social services at a useful speed, and I worried about food again.

                        <figcaption>"We shall not be moved."  A woman holds a sign at a protest.</figcaption>

                    <p>
                        When I was 16, my mother moved out and left my sister alone in a scary house with no food.   I had to ask friends for food because I didn't have a cent of money or anyone who knew about mine and my sister's situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At home as a small child, I was afraid to go downstairs to eat.  My home was a very dangerous place for a child.  I just went hungry instead.  The kids made fun of me in school for my weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have started to understand that while I have had some rough times, in many ways I have been lucky.  Many people live on the edge of poverty, if not completely impoverished.  To add to the mess, it's basically illegal to be improverished in this culture.  Once down, you are easily a target for a swift kick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While dealing with my history of trauma, abuse, and neglect, I have have found a huge well of untapped energy.  I'd like to use Queen Starship to teach kids and adults the joys of engineering and STEAM, while enabling anyone to build a home they can afford. To enable folks to create a sustainable source of food.  In addition, I have a special interest in personal security.  So think of Queen Starship as a technology education project.  More to come.
